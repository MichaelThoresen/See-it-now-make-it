        <h1>The problem</h1>
        
        <p>Everything technological that is too time consuming is a problem from a technological 
perspective. Especially if we could get the work done in minutes. Let’s look at these kinds of 
problems. But first, let us ask you some questions. Are you aware of all th
e services that are 
connected to your email address? Have you always had the same email address ever since you 
created one? You would probably answer “no” to at least one of the questions above. Then you 
would probably have experienced problems with unwant
ed emails or problems with changing 
to new email address without knowing the important services that has your old email address. 
Let's look at what people say about this.</p>
        
        <h2>Our research</h2>
        
        <p>We made a survey consisting of six questions. The survey was conducted i
n november 2016 
among 100 email users from different age groups all around the world. The users were 
informed about that this survey is only being used to this final project. We will use the results of 
the survey to show the importance of the problems we w
ill address soon. 
The results:</p>
        
        <center><img src="1.png"></center>
        
        <p>Here we can see that 6% of the users were from age 12
-
18, 38% of user were from age 19
-
40, 
39% of the users 
were from age 41
-
55 and 6% from age 56+.</p>

This diagram shows that over 90% of the people didn't have the same email address ever since 
they 
created one.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows how our users handle unwanted emails. The majority of the users delete it, 
ignore it or try to 
unsubscribe from the sender.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows that over 70% of the users would have used the application we will be 
describing as our sol
ution for the problems we will be adressing now.</p>
        
        <h3>the first problem</h3>
        
        <p>The first problem: Unwanted emails. How do you handle unwanted emails? You can try to 
manually go and unsubscribe from every sender of the unwanted emails, delete every time you 
get an unwa
nted email, ignore every time you get an unwanted email, set up filters or report 
the unwanted email as spam. Let’s look at how our email users handle this problem.</p>
        
        <center><img src="6.png"></center>
        
        <p>These methods to prevent unwanted emails are too time consuming or annoying. From a 
technological perspective, this is a problem. How can we possibly prevent this time consuming 
work with unwanted emails? The answer is “e
-
Tracker”. We will tell you about i
t later. But first, 
let us address the second problem.</p>
        
        <center><h4>The Second Problem</h4></center>
        
        <p>The first time you created an email address, you probably wouldn’t have thought of using it for 
professional inquiries. So, your first email address would have been something like 
se
xyboy97@live.no, barbie23@gmail.com, kittygirl@yahoo.com or kingofoslo@hotmail.com. 
And now you want your email address to be more professional. So, you create a new email 
address. Or you just have another good reason to change your email address, so you c
reate a 
new one. Here you can see how many of our email users that have changed their email 
addresses. 
Which is over 90% as said earlier.</p>
        
        <center><img src="2.png"></center>
        
        <p>But you have your previous email address registered to so many services that you don’t have 
any overview over the important ones. So, you must manually go and find the important 
services and send an email about your new email address. This is also time consu
ming which is 
also a problem from a technological perspective. And as said over 70% of our survey answerers 
think this is a big problem too.</p>

        <p>How can we possibly prevent this time
-
consuming work forever? The answer for this one is “e
-
Tracker” too. What is this e
-
Tracker? The “e
-
Tracker” is a web
-
based application and our 
solution for the problems we adressed. You can read about our solution by c
